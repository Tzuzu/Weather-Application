# Weather Tracking Application

If you wish to view and test the website out for yourself, you may do so [here](https://tzuzu.github.io/Weather-Application/)

## Purpose

The purpose of this application will to be able to search for a city and have the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast for that city be displayed. After the user has searched for the city, it will be displayed on the left hand side with their 8 most recent searches in order to return to cities easily.

## What I've Learned

The biggest thing that I learned from this assignment is that you need to constantly check to make sure that your functions are being called at the correct time and in the correct order. I had spent an extra day trying to find out why my search history wasn't loading unless the page refreshed, when all that needed to be done was to have the function be called again at the end of another function.
